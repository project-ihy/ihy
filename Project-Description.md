## Faculty Advisor

Currently we are in the process of searching for a faculty advisor.

## Background Description

Due to a shared background in musical theory among all members of the project, the idea of an intelligent music synthesizer was born to revolutionize the music industry.

## Problem Statement

Composing new and original music is a challenging and time-consuming task for most producers. In the new age of technology, music has become more electronic-based and sophisticaed than ever before. Although there are tools which synthesize and edit music, there are no readily available technological solutions for generating music.

## Inadequacy of Current Solutions

Current music generators are either difficult for use or require extensive music theory knowledge before use. They also don't use melodies that a user previously generated, but instead create something from scratch.

This project will act more as a collaborator to the user than as the sole means for musical prodcution which can be used by both beginners and experts.

## Background Skills

Members of this team have extensive background in music theory from personal endeavors. Each member has experience with Python, which will be the primary language used for the project.

## Approach to Problem

Using a general midi-signal synthesizer as a foundation, the project will use an algorithmic approach to generate musical melodies and harmonies. It will intake user input for general style of the melody and generate from that an aesthetically pleasing songpiece, including saturation and syncopation.

It will also analyze popular songs of various genres and determine characteristics which make them aesthetically pleasing to humans. It will incorporate these characteristics into the melodies it generates.

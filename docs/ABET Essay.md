# ABET Constraints of Project Ihy

## Ethical Constraints

The largest groups of people this project will have an impact on are composers and songwriters. I think there is a very strongly held opinion that music is innately bound to humanity. This makes sense because humans have been the only ones who have ever made music, and really are the only ones who consume it. Because of this, I foresee people, especially creators of music, getting offended by the idea of music that was created by a computer. Society saw a similar reaction after the introduction of synthesizers. People viewed songs that featured synthesizers as lesser because the sounds were not acoustically created. Even today, there are armchair critics disparaging EDM artists because their songs were entirely made on computers. To these people I say: “Who cares?”. Why should it matter if a song was created in 2 hours on a laptop instead of being born out of years of daily practice? If the song sounds good, and people enjoy it, the means used to create it are irrelevant. 

## Social Constraints

Music is a major component of our culture. Many people write and perform music professionally and as a hobby. Our project will help these composers and musicians write and arrange music. This will enable musicians to quickly iterate on musical ideas and innovate without worrying about technical details.  Recent developments in experimental music like vaporwave and its various subgenres have embraced computer generated music. Hopefully our project will further the advancement of  these musical movements and provide a framework for musicians and composers to develop innovative new ideas.

## Economic Constraints
In the modern world of technology, the recent boom in the industry has given rise to an era of innovation and sharing. Because of this, open-sourced development has become a norm for software development. Ihy will be no different; Ihy will be an open-sourced plugin for an open-sourced tool. Ihy will be free for anyone to use, and will be cost-free to produce. The project will not be composed of any form of paid software and the developers will not be compensated for the production of it. There will be no hardware purchases necessary for the project.

## Professional Constraints

As software developers, our careers will be impacted indirectly. Our musical expertise will likely be irrelevant in the industry. Our implementation of plugins and ease of use will be the focal point for our professional careers. We do, however, have to have a solid grasp on music theory concepts in order to successfully and effectively produce this project. The final version of our product will be pushed to MuseScore’s open-source code, so our project will be freely available for the world to use. This will be easily presentable through our professional portfolios.

# Project Ihy Mailestones, Timeline and Effort Matrix

## Milestones

1. Planning - We will create a report and presentation mapping out our goals

2. Development (Individual features) - We will individually start development on the UI, Analysis Engine, Synthesis Engine, and Music Packaging components of the project. 

3. Integration of all features - We will integrate the four components of the project together

4. Testing - We will test the application, fix bugs, and refactor code.

5. Documentation - We will write documentation for the application.

6. Open-Sourcing - We will will open source the project.

| Research Musescore plugins. | 85 | 5 | 5 | 5 |
| Create a Musescore plugin that will allow the user to specify settings for the music they wish to generate and input musical snippets to act as a base for the generated music. | 85 | 5 | 5 | 5 |
| Integrate the plugin with music analyzer so that the so that the userâ€™s inputs will be sent to the analyzer in order to generate music. | 85 | 5 | 5 | 5 |
| Test the plugin. | 85 | 5 | 5 | 5 |
| Document the plugin at https://musescore.org/en/plugins | 85 | 5 | 5 | 5 |
| Research tools and strategies for packaging musical pieces into midi files. | 5 | 5 | 85 | 5 |
| Implement a packaging technique, incorporating it into the existing musescore code base. | 5 | 5 | 85 | 5 |
| Test the implementation to ensure expected functionality. | 5 | 5 | 85 | 5 |
| Integrate the packager with other components of the Ihy project to validate that each component interfaces correctly with the other. | 5 | 5 | 85 | 5 |
| Document design practices and decisions throughout the process researching, developing, testing and integrating. | 5 | 5 | 85 | 5 |
| Research tools and strategies for analyzing components of musical pieces. | 5 | 85 | 5 | 5 |
| Specify and implement a music analyzer design strategy, incorporating it into the existing musescore code base. | 5 | 85 | 5 | 5 |
| Test the implementation of the music analyzer to ensure expected functionality. | 5 | 85 | 5 | 5 |
| Integrate the music analyzer with other components of the Ihy project to validate that each component interfaces correctly with the other. | 5 | 85 | 5 | 5 |
| Document design practices and decisions throughout the process researching, developing, testing and integrating. | 5 | 85 | 5 | 5 |
| Research existing generation strategies. | 5 | 5 | 5 | 85 |
| Design and implement synthesis of new music given analysis of existing music and generation attributes. | 5 | 5 | 5 | 85 |
| Test that generated scores are within constraints defined by the attributes. | 5 | 5 | 5 | 85 |
| Integrate into rest of project. Consider approaches: within Musescore plugin environment or external? | 5 | 5 | 5 | 85 |
| Document the generation process, including any core abstractions used. | 5 | 5 | 5 | 85 |

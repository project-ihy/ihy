## Work Experience

#### Projetech - Developer Co-op (Fall 2016, Summer 2017, Jan. 2018 - Present)
  - Develop and eventually manage a complex internal automation tool written in Clojure
  - This tool is used for performing maintenance tasks (upgrades, prod->dev refreshes) on the 800+
	Maximo instances that Projetech hosts for its clients.
  - Architect technical solutions to address changes in business
    needs. Most recently, we needed to change all of our master->slave
    server communications to happen over websockets, because
    provisioning a slave server would require a site to site VPN,
    which was a non-starter for some customers.
  - Assist with requirements development and sprint planning
  - Set up servers and deploy fortnightly releases
  - Pair program to develop features and write tests
  - Support and train users on the tool
  - Find and quickly resolve bugs in production

#### Siemens PLM Software - Developer Co-op (Fall 2015)
  - Developed an internal java application to assist QA testing
  - Became familiar with a large existing codebase

#### AFRL/DSRC (internships, summers 2014 & 2015)
  - Worked on 2 separate web development projects
  - Gave technical reports on projects

#### AFRL (5-week Internship)
  - Developed an Android app for internal use with another intern

## Project Sought
I'd like to do something with algorithmic music composition. I'd
prefer it to be in a functional language, ideally Clojure.
